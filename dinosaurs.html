                <p id="description">First discovered in Colorado, United States, Brachiosaurus is a sauropod from the Late Jurassic
                    period. It can be distinguished from other sauropods by its extra-long front legs, which gave its
                    body a downward-sloping appearance.

                    The genus name Brachiosaurus, which means “arm lizard”, refers to the dinosaur’s long front legs.

                    Brachiosaurus is likely to have held its neck erect, and would have been capable of reaching foliage
                    around 50 ft / 15 m above the ground.</p>

                    <li>Type of dinosaur: Theropod</li>
                    <li>Size: 40 ft. / 12.3 m</li>

                <p>It should come as no surprise that the number one dinosaur in this list of the most famous dinosaurs
                    is… Tyrannosaurus Rex.

                    It says much about the popularity of this dinosaur that Tyrannosaurus Rex is one of the few
                    dinosaurs to be known by its species name, rather than by the wider genus name.

                    In scientific terminology, a species name has two words, the first word being the genus (in this
                    case Tyrannosaurus, meaning “tyrant lizard”); the second word being an identifying name (in this
                    case, rex, meaning “king”).

                    When discussing species, it is usual for biologists to use the initial of the genus name rather than
                    repeating it. That's why Tyrannosaurus Rex is often known simply as: T. rex.

                    (It’s also customary to italicize genus and species names.)

                    T. rex is usually thought of as an apex predator, but it’s likely that the species was also at least
                    partly a scavenger.

                    The skull of T. rex was heavily-built and its jaws suggest that it had a powerful bite force. The
                    largest T. rex teeth were around 12 in. / 30 cm in length, including the root.

                    Although the forelimbs of T. rex were short, they were thought to be powerful. It is likely that
                    they were used to prevent prey from escaping.
                    T. rex lived right at the end of the Cretaceous Period, and this famous dinosaur was likely one of
                    the last dinosaurs to have lived</p>

                <ul id="specifics">
                    <li>Type of dinosaur: Ornithischian</li>
                    <li>Size: 30 ft. / 9m</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Triceratops was a large, powerful, plant-eating dinosaur that lived in what is now North America. It
                    is one of the most famous dinosaurs, and one of the most recognizable, due to its three horns (one
                    on its snout, the other two at the top of its face), and the large bony shield that extends
                    backwards from the back of the skull.

                    The horns and shield may have been defensive adaptations against predators (Triceratops lived
                    alongside fearsome predators such as Tyrannosaurus Rex), but they may have been used for courtship
                    or establishing dominance against other Triceratops.</p>

                <ul id="specifics">
                    <li>Type of dinosaur: Therapod</li>
                    <li>Size: 56 ft. / 17 m.</li>
                    <li>Period: Late Cretaceous
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The first Spinosaurus was discovered in Egypt in 1912. Unfortunately, the specimen was destroyed when
                    the museum in Germany in which they were being stored was bombed during the war.

                    Several more Spinosaurus fossils have since been found, also in North Africa.

                    Spinosaurus is one of the biggest land predators ever to have lived. Like other spinosaurids, it had
                    elongated spines on its back. These are thought to have supported a sail made of skin.

                    Paleontologists are unsure of the purpose of the Spinosaurus’s sail. It may have helped to keep the
                    dinosaur at the correct temperature, or have been used as a display to attract mates. Another
                    explanation is that it helped Spinosaurus move through the water while swimming. Spinosaurus’s long,
                    thin jaws and sharp teeth suggest it was a fish eater.

                <ul id="specifics">
                    <li>Type of dinosaur: Theropod</li>
                    <li>Size: 1 ft. / 30cm long</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The discovery of Archaeopteryx, a crow-sized, feathered dinosaur, provided evidence to support
                    Charles Darwin’s theory of Evolution. This is because Archaeopteryx had characteristics of both
                    reptiles and birds, suggesting that the ancestors of Archaeopteryx were dinosaurs and that its
                    descendants would be modern birds. Fossils such as these are known as “Transitional fossils”.

                    Archaeopteryx had feathered wings and may have been capable of true flight instead of simply gliding
                    – although this is a source of disagreement between paleontologists. Unlike modern birds (and like
                    reptiles), it had teeth and a long tail.

                    The importance of Archaeopteryx in establishing the link between dinosaurs and birds, together with
                    its extremely well-preserved fossils, mean that it is one of the most famous dinosaurs.</p>
