# Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

Feature-by-Feature Testing:

I was navigating through all parts of the deployed website in desktop version on a Mac-Book Pro with the Chrome-Browser. I´ve tested if the transitions between the different pages (about us; member; meet the dinosaurs) are smooth.

I scrolled up and down the home-page and checked if it displays correct and all elements are in the right place with a good visibility.

I scrolled up and down the member-page and checked if it displays correct and all elements are in the right place with a good visibility.

I scrolled up and down the meet-the dinosaurs-page and checked if it displays correct and all elements are in the right place with a good visibility.

I was testing the hover function on all of the pages.

I was testing if the links to the social-networks in the footer are working properly and opening a separate window with the correct destination. 

I tested the sign-up form in the member section. I was testing if all the required fields (first name; last name; email-address) are mandatory to send the form. I was testing if the confirmation-page for the form is beeing displayed and working properly and is redirecting to the home-page.

I was testing if the 404 page displays and redirects to the home-page properly.

I opened the Dev-Tools in the Crome-Browser and repeated all of the steps above for all of the devices provided screen-sizes.

I opened the deployed website on my Iphone 13 Pro with Safari- and Chrome-Browser and repeated all the testings above.

During the Feature-by-Feature Testing no bugs have been encountered.




User Experience and Usability Testing:

I was sending the deployed link to three independent test-users.

Feedback-User1 (Iphone 8 with Safari Browser): Everything works well, website is easy to use. Submitting of form was working well." 


Feedback-User2 (Iphone Safari Browser): "With Safari on the Iphone everythings alright during a fast check"


Feedback-User3 (SamsungS20 with Chrome-Browser): "Could navigate through the website easily"


During the User-Testing no issues have been encountered.


Accessibility Testing: Confirm compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., screen reader compatibility, proper alt text for images, keyboard navigation).

I´ve used the hover function in the Chrome-Devtools to make sure the used background/font-color combination provides a good readability on the screen
----SCREENSHOT----

While testing the alt-attributes of the images I´ve found brachio and spino to be not specific enough. I´ve changed them to brachiosaurus and spinosaurus.
----SCREENSHOT----

While testing the keyboard navigation, I´ve encountered that the Burger-Icon isn´t accessible via keyboad-navigation. I´ve decided to not focus on fixing the bug. I found it to be a problem of a very limited audience, as most users are going to access the page via Smartphone, Tablet, Laptop or Desktop-Computer with mouse. The benefit ist to small to justify the effort in my opinion.


Compatibility Testing:

- Chrome-Browser

- Firefox Developer Edition

- Safari



Performance Testing:

Regression Testing:

Changes have been made to the alt attributes which have been tested and don´t effect the page in any way.



## Code Validation



### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Browser Compatibility

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing AT LEAST 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

You DO NOT need to use all of the browsers below, just pick any 3 (minimum).

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

Sample browser testing documentation:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

## Responsiveness

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

## Lighthouse Audit

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

## Bugs

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

This section is primarily used for JavaScript and Python applications,
but feel free to use this section to document any HTML/CSS bugs you might run into.

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

## Unfixed Bugs

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.
I really 
    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:
